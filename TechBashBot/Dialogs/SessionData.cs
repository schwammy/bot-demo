But it doesn\'t have to be a violent revolution. The end goal might be breaking your existing ASP.NET monolith into microservices which run cross-platform on .NET Core, but the first step can be as simple as packaging your whole .Net Framework application as-is into a Docker image and running it as a container. In this session I\'ll take an existing ASP.NET WebForms application and package it as a Docker image, which can run in a container on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10. I\'ll show you how to run the app and a SQL Server database in Docker containers on Windows, and how to use Docker Compose to define the structure of a distributed application. Then I\'ll iteratively add functionality to the app, making use of the Docker platform to modernize the monolith without a full rebuild. I\'ll take a feature-driven approach and show you how Docker makes it easy to address performance, usability and design issues.','SpeakerName':'Anoop Kumar','StartTime':'2017-10-04T15:30:00','LocationName':'HomeNet - Sagewood Room'},{'Title':'Building Mixed Reality Experiences for HoloLens & Immersive Headsets in Unity','Description':'Mixed Reality blends people, places and things across a full spectrum ranging from the real-world to digital virtual worlds.
